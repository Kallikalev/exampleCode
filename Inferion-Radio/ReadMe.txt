This is a radio mod made by Inferion. Discord Inferion#1280

To use:
Clicking the green plus sign will scan your face as it was the moment you hit the button.
If you are wearing custom clothes this may take some time so it is suggested that you run the scan in singleplayer.

If you want to use a custom drawn portrait, create a new 46x48 pixel image and put it in "Starbound/mods/Inferion-Radio/improvedRadio/customPortraits/".
When you are done drawing make sure you have restarted the game or reloaded, then type the name of the image into the lower text box. You only need to type
the name of the image like "example.png" (without quotes), not the full file path. When you click the green plus it should start a scan of your custom image.
If you typed the image name wrong or have the image in the wrong location then your scanned image will end up being blank.

Use the left and right arrows to swap between images.

Use the red minus button to delete a mode. You cannot delete your last image, so if you want it gone then make a new scan of your face first.

For unknown reasons, it is important that your image has a high bit depth. The image may turn out completely white in your scanner. All images used while making
the mod had a 32 bit depth, and an image that a tester used that didn't work had a 4 bit depth.
